        <h2><a href="goal">Goals</a></h2>
        <p>Everyone should have goals. While life doesn't always go with your goals, but patience is the key. My goal is to find a place where I can use my skills and talents to make something better. I am a man of many skills and a master of a few. I'm currently studying to become a full stack developer along side my current job as an applications engineer at an accessibility company where I design home elevators. </p>
